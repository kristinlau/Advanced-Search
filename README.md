Advanced Search Mock-up

We have been asking clients for feedback for Murray’s user stories. Sirtex had a bunch of questions that I think our new advanced search will address. Searching across multiple cats at ones will help her. I wanted to share a soft ETA for her
on when the Aadvanced Search will be ready?

Here is the feedback from my MPC at Sirtex:

“Frist, the searchability for Policy reporter is not that user friendly. If you don’t select the right key terms not all the Y-90 coverage policies will show up.  It would help to have all SIRT/Radioembolization coverage polices were organized on one page  alphabetically by payer.

I use the Medicare fee schedules and the coverage polices, however, I would appreciate an easier way to access all SIRT Y-90 policies in place.”

It would also be helpful for users to have the ability to save specific searches and be able to run "OR" searches.
